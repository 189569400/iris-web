# IRIS

[![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL_v3-blue.svg)](./LICENSE.txt)   
IRIS is a web collaborative platform for incident response analysts allowing to share investigations at a technical level.

## Getting started
It is divided in two main parts, IrisWeb and IrisModules.   
 - IrisWeb is the web application which contains the core of
Iris (web interface, database management, etc). 
 - IrisModules are extensions of the core that allow third parties to process
data via Iris (eg enrich IOCs with MISP and VT, upload and injection of EVTX into Splunk). 
 
IrisWeb can work without any modules though defaults ones are preinstalled. Head to ``Manage > Modules`` in the UI 
to configure and enable them. 

### Run IrisWeb 
Iris is split on 5 Docker services, each with a different role.

- ``app - iris_webapp``: The core, including web server, DB management, module management etc.
- ``db``: A PostgresSQL database
- ``RabbitMQ``: A RabbitMQ engine to handle jobs queuing and processing
- ``worker``: Jobs handler relying on RabbitMQ
- ``nginx``: A NGINX reverse proxy

Each service can be built independently, which can be useful when developing.

``` bash
#  Clone the iris-web repository
git clone https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-web.git
cd iris-web

# Copy the environment file 
cp .env.model .env
# [... optionally, do some configuration as specified below ...]

# Build the dockers
docker-compose build

# Run IRIS 
docker-compose up
```

Iris will be available on the host interface, port 4433, protocol HTTPS - ``https://<your_instance_ip>:4433``.  
By default, an ``administrator`` account is created. The password is printed in stdout the very first time Iris is started. It won't be printed anymore after that.  
You can search for ``WARNING :: post_init :: create_safe_admin :: >>>`` in the logs to find the password.  

If you want to define an admin password at the first start, you can also create and define the environment variable **IRIS_ADM_PASSWORD** in the `app` docker instance (see the webApp Dockerfile). This has no effects once the administrator account is created.   

## Optional configuration

You can skip this part if you just want to try or develop. If used in production, please configure the .env file at the root of the project:

- Nginx: you might want to specify your own certificate as specified above
- Database credentials: **POSTGRES_PASSWORD** and **DB_PASS** (you can also customise the usernames)
- IRIS secrets: **SECRET_KEY** and **SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT**

## Showcase
For a more comprehensive overview of the case features, 
you can head to [tutorials](https://dfir-iris.github.io/operations/tutorials/), we've put some videos there.  

## Upgrades
Please read the release notes when upgrading versions. Most of the time the migrations are handled automatically, but some
changes might require manual labor depending on the version. 

## Documentation
A comprehensive documentation is available on [dfir-iris.github.io](https://dfir-iris.github.io).

## API
The API reference is available in the [documentation](https://dfir-iris.github.io/operations/api/#references) or [documentation repository](https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-doc-src).

## Help
You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/76tM6QUJza) or by [mail](mailto:contact@dfir-iris.org) if you have any question, issue or idea !

## Considerations
Iris is in its early stage. It can already be used in production, but please set backups of the database and DO NOT expose the interface on the Internet. We highly recommend using a private dedicated and secured network.
